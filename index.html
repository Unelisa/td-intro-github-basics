  <h1>What is Version Control</h1>

 <p> A system known as version control tracks changes made to a group of files or a piece of code over time. <br>
It makes it possible for numerous contributors to work on the same project at once while keeping track of the changes made by each one.<br> 
Version control is mostly used in software development projects to keep track of changes made and to promote developer collaboration.</p>

   <h1> Git</h1>

 <p>Git is a distributed version control system that is frequently employed in the creation of software and other team-based initiatives. <br>
At its core, Git is a technology that enables teamwork by enabling several <br>
developers to work on the same codebase concurrently while tracking changes, recording modifications, and maintaining a history of changes.</p>
